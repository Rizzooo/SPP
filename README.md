Description: 
GameSleeve is a game-management app for those who wish to be more organized with the games they have. With GameSleeve you can save and edit your game collection whenever you please, allowing you to go back and see what you have and what you may want to pick up next!

Usage: 
To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. From there everything should be set up!
